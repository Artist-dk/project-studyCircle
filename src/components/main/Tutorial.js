<h1>Computer Networking Tutorial</h1>

<h2>Introduction to Computer Networking</h2>
<p>Computer networking is the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources and communicate with each other. It enables data transfer, resource sharing, and collaboration among users.</p>

<h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
<p>Here are some fundamental concepts in computer networking:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Network:</strong> A network is a collection of interconnected devices that can communicate with each other.</li>
  <li><strong>Protocol:</strong> A protocol is a set of rules governing data communication between devices in a network.</li>
  <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network.</li>
  <li><strong>Router:</strong> A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks.</li>
  <li><strong>Switch:</strong> A switch is a networking device that connects devices within a network and forwards data to the appropriate destination.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Types of Networks</h2>
<p>Computer networks can be categorized into different types based on their geographical scope and architecture:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>LAN (Local Area Network):</strong> A LAN is a network that spans a small geographical area, such as a home, office, or building.</li>
  <li><strong>WAN (Wide Area Network):</strong> A WAN is a network that spans a large geographical area, such as multiple cities or countries.</li>
  <li><strong>MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):</strong> A MAN is a network that spans a city or metropolitan area.</li>
  <li><strong>Wireless Network:</strong> A wireless network uses wireless communication technology, such as Wi-Fi, to connect devices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Networking Protocols</h2>
<p>Networking protocols define the rules and conventions for communication between devices. Some common networking protocols include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>TCP/IP:</strong> Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol is the foundational protocol suite of the Internet.</li>
  <li><strong>HTTP/HTTPS:</strong> Hypertext Transfer Protocol and its secure version are protocols for transmitting data over the web.</li>
  <li><strong>FTP:</strong> File Transfer Protocol is used for transferring files between a client and a server on a network.</li>
  <li><strong>SMTP:</strong> Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is used for sending email messages between servers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This concludes our basic tutorial on computer networking. We've covered introductory concepts, types of networks, and common networking protocols. There's much more to learn in this field, including network security, routing, and network administration.</p>
